In a large pan, brown the chicken in a little oil. Drain off any excess fat, then add the tomatoes, stock and garlic. Simmer for 45 minutes, then add all the other ingredients. Cook on a low heat for a further 30 minutes. Before serving, shred the chicken from the bone and add it back to the pan, discarding the bones and skin, then season to taste.
